    "raw": "It is not hard to see how Louzy got its name. A small world with an atmosphere both tainted and too thin to breathe, lacking much in the way of water, it was hardly a garden world nor a prime prospect for colonisation.\n\nNevertheless, Louzy was indeed colonised and the colonies grew rapidly. The world proved to be rich in mineral resources and enjoyed something of a ‘gold rush’ in the mid 600s as the sector’s industrial base was hugely expanded to meet the needs of the Fleet Asset Replacement Programme. FARP was implemented in several sectors that had lost a large proportion of their naval assets in the Civil War or as reinforcements sent to the Marches to fight the Zhodani.\n\nAt that time, the Imperial Navy was facing a crisis. Its strength had been built up steadily, literally over centuries. The massive losses of the Frontier Wars and, more importantly, the Civil War meant a large percentage of the fleet needed replacing and fast. System defence assets also required replacement in heavily fought-over systems. Crash-building programmes covered the worst of the deficit within a couple of decades but this created a second crisis as ships suffered block obsolescence, all needing replacement at once rather than over time.\n\nAll this meant there was a massive need for mineral resources in the coreward end of the Marches and significantly at the military shipyards of neighbouring Efate. Huge extraction and ore processing operations were rapidly set up, along with towns for workers and associated secondary and tertiary industries.\n\nThe expansion was extremely quick; Louzy was a metaphorical goldmine of minerals and the industry of the Marches could not get enough of its riches. Wages were high and living conditions in the mining towns were as good as the corporations could make them. The best corp towns were operated by Sternmetal Horizons but other firms followed a similar practice, in order to attract workers.\n\nIt succeeded. Louzy was the place to go if you needed a job, or if you wanted to learn, for education and training packages were included among the extra benefits offered to workers coming to Louzy. Seemingly every week there was a new mine or processing plant opening, with new arrivals coming to operate it and seasoned hands taking promotions to head work gangs in the new facility.\n\nIt had to end sooner or later and, by the early 700s the voracious demand for minerals had tailed off. So had Louzy’s massive productivity; easy-to-access deposits were mined out and some installations closed, plus many industrial centres were getting their raw materials elsewhere, at a better price.\n\nSome operations moved to less viable, but still productive, sites and carried on. The megacorporations pulled out, to their credit taking care of their own people by moving them to new sites or investing in corp towns to make them self-sustaining. These former corp towns ended up in better shape than most settlements, as their former corporate owners helped create a modest industrial base. Most other settlements had little industry outside of repair workshops for their mining equipment.\n\nThe Louzy Slump followed, inevitably. The world’s riches had come from exporting processed ore and not only was that more difficult to get at, there was little in the way of local manufacturing capacity to make use of raw materials now the interstellar market was not buying everything that could be torn out of the ground.\n\nLouzy struggled through hard times. Its economy was based on ore that needed advanced machinery to mine and keeping that machinery (as well as the cities themselves) operating consumed the money from ore sales. Occasionally, fighting broke out over a claim or attempt to salvage equipment from a previous mining operation.\n\nHowever, things settled down in time. A world government was formed out of representatives of the mining settlements and collective bargaining improved cashflow. Many smaller settlements were salvaged and closed down, the population migrating to cities that had industry and services, mostly former corporation towns. Careful management of the expansion program prevented the creation of ready-made slums and ensured people that came in from the failing settlements were an asset to local industry rather than a drain.\n\nToday, Louzy is strictly-regulated but stable, with a modest mid-tech industrial base exporting some raw materials and an increasing amount of finished goods through the remains of what was once a very extensive starport. The latter is currently rated as a D class port but could be refurbished to C or even B class with suitable investment.\n\nThe world’s main problem is overpopulation in its sprawling cities, which are constructed largely underground to maintain atmospheric integrity. Money is tight and there is little investment but investment is desperately needed in order to get more from the world’s huge population. Needing money to generate wealth and not being able to get it, Louzy is facing a downward spiral. Crime is on the increase and most citizens feel they have few prospects. It may be that the valiant effort made to halt the great slump has merely slowed it and made the decline more painful.\n\nEfforts are underway to improve matters. Imperial funding and megacorporate loans have been requested, without much success, although there have been some instances of private concerns moving into Louzy on very favourable terms. The world government seems increasingly willing to entertain distinctly borderline schemes if they bring in hard cash.\n\nThere is a steady exodus of people offworld. Some are the best and brightest, using their skills to find a better home for their families. Most, however, are semi-skilled at best. Some simply buy a ticket for anywhere or work passage aboard a passing ship in the hope of finding a new start in a better place. Others are recruited by mercenary units and other high-risk companies seeking personnel. Ironically, the biggest recruiters operating on Louzy are mining companies seeking entry-level workers. Although these recruitment operations are small-scale at present, they are expanding. This is a good thing – a few less people is exactly what Louzy needs right now.",
