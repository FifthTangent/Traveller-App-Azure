    "raw": "Keng fits the popular image of a frontier world in many ways. Lying at the outer edge of a cluster of stars reached from the Spinward Main by a jump-2 ship, although with difficulty due to Red Zoned worlds and planets with very poor starports along the way, Keng is one of the outer worlds of the Imperium. With the Vargr Extents only a few parsecs away and no viable destinations to travel onward to, Keng is a dead end as far as travel goes.\n\nFor this reason, among others, Keng’s colonists never emerged onto the interstellar stage. Although the world was settled by several colony missions, none really made a go of it. The population increased and spread out but the Tech Level gradually fell as equipment wore out before an indigenous technological base was created.\n\nKeng is habitable enough. Although small, it has a standard-density atmosphere whose taint is tolerable to those who have had many generations to become immune to it. Surface water is in short supply but not sufficiently so to limit human expansion.\n\nThe original settlement pattern was typical of such worlds; colony missions landed close to water sources, usually where other resources were also available. This resulted in a number of colonial hubs, from which the population spread out where water was abundant.\n\nWith relatively few seas and rivers to limit travel, a steady creep across the surface was easy enough. Conversely, there was no cheap and easy method of moving heavy loads, as there would have been on wetter worlds with watercourses, so secondary settlements tended to be small and created with what was easily carried. This limited long-term development of anything other than agricultural towns.\n\nAs the population grew and spread, the high-tech equipment of the colonial hubs gradually gave out and was replaced with lower-tech alternatives. Subsequent colony missions repeated the process elsewhere on the planet but there was never quite enough investment to break the process of set-up, spread, and decline.\n\nToday, the population of Keng numbers several hundred million people, dispersed about the planet in several clumps, with large areas of wilderness in between. Each clump has a central city built around the original colony site, along with a series of rings, each of smaller and smaller towns and villages. Industry, such as it is, is concentrated in the cities while smaller communities trade agricultural produce for industrial items.\n\nMost cities are now linked by a vast rail network. Steam trains labour across huge areas of wilderness to maintain contact between towns and cities, enabling what passes for a world government despite the world’s low Tech Level. The ruling elite are sometimes referred to as ‘rail barons’ by offworlders. Only a few cities have the industrial and technical ability to build and maintain the locomotives, rail manufacturing factories and telegraph stations needed to participate in the work of governance. The remainder are rated TL3 by the Scout Service but are towards the bottom end of the classification, while many outlying towns can be considered TL2.\n\nAlthough local law prohibits the carrying of any weapon within the cities, the outback is an entirely different matter. The government recognises that weapons are necessary for self-defence and, equally importantly, trying to take them away from the outback farmers and steaders would be a hazardous proposition.\n\nKeng is by no means a safe world. It has an ecosystem of its own, to which has been added a range of plants and animals of offworld origin, some from Terra. There are a number of predators willing to take on adult humans if hungry enough and, as a result, the farmers of the outlying communities are a tough and resourceful lot who value their weapons greatly. Most are handmade black powder guns from the cities, though a significant number of Keng Outbackers (as they are known) are proficient with the bow or sling.\n\nTrade ships that come through Keng find little on offer in the markets besides agricultural products, which are not available in great enough quantities to make bulk shipping worthwhile. The world therefore receives few visitors and has virtually no export revenue. Keng is as close to a truly isolated world as it is possible to get; there are hardly any imports because there is nothing to buy them with, and no-one coming to the world to sell them anyway.\n\nAs a result of this economic and physical isolation, Keng receives almost no notice from the Imperium and simply goes its own way. There are areas of the planet that have hardly been explored or even surveyed from orbit since the days of the first landings centuries ago.",
