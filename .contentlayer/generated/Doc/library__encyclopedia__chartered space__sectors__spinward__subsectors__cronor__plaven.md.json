    "raw": "Plaven is a large world with a thin, tainted atmosphere and a reasonable amount of surface water. It is capable of supporting life and was settled by colonists as the Imperium moved into the Marches. These arrived in an ad-hoc and disorganised manner, often without proper long-term planning or necessary equipment. Although semi-random colonisation is discouraged by the Colonial Office, it is not possible to prevent it along the frontiers.\n\nIn the case of Plaven, there was no organised settlement programme. The world was far out on the frontier and by the time it was surveyed, interest in expansion was waning. Rather than a central and well-organised colonial effort alongside random groups of landgrabbers, there was only the latter. If any given settlement hit hard times, there was no-one to turn to for help and no ICO-sponsored colonial hub to join if the independent effort failed.\n\nSome colonists did well, others failed and died out, left or else joined other bands and shared their fortunes. The various tiny colonies never reached the critical mass necessary to become stable and grow, nor to pull in offworld trade.\n\nAs a result, Plaven’s small population struggled at subsistence level. High-tech gear wore out and although the colonists adapted to the world’s tainted atmosphere, their numbers dwindled steadily. Plaven was passed over by the four Frontier Wars, its nominal allegiance changing hands in treaty negotiations without any effect on the population. Plaven is now officially independent and part of the demilitarised zone between the Imperium and the Zhodani Consulate. If the locals even know about this, chances are they do not care.\n\nToday, Plaven’s population is officially listed by the IISS as several hundred people subsisting without formal government, in a number of tiny hamlets and homesteads capable of supporting a steam-powered economy. There is no law as such, although the locals enforce their own basic code of conduct and have a working society based on the authority of senior family members.\n\nThe largest settlement contains about 80 people and is located close to a flat area of exposed rock that makes for a good, stable landing place for the occasional starship, with water from a nearby stream available to be cracked for hydrogen to make fuel. However, there are few reasons for anyone to visit Plaven – it is not even on the way to anywhere – so what might be termed a starport receives very few ships.\n\nThe official IISS figures for the population of Plaven may not be exact. Once every few years a Scout Service ship lands at the port and its personnel carry out a population census. Figures for the area around the port are probably accurate; Plaven is one of the few worlds where the IISS census actually lists every resident of the planet by name. However, it is possible that other enclaves exist elsewhere on the planet, perhaps survivors from another colonial settlement that went their own way.\n\nIf other groups exist, they have thus far avoided official notice and inclusion in the census figures. This could be done easily enough, deliberately, but equally could happen through a combination of low technology, remote location and less than zealous surveying by bored IISS crews sent to the far end of the Imperium to count heads on some distant rockball.\n\nIt is possible that other groups might have higher or lower Tech Levels than the official population, although higher tech would have to be deliberately concealed as emissions would be noticeable to even the most cursory survey. It is known that several remnant sites do exist, where early colonies were created then closed down or failed. Occasionally a free trader lands at one of these ruins, having mistaken it for a living settlement, and returns to Imperial space with wild tales of a ghost planet or worldwide catastrophe.\n\nMost of these settlements were stripped long ago for whatever could be salvaged but some are very remote, beyond the reach of any of the remaining colonies. It is possible that some of these remain intact. The occasional salvage mission is launched by freelancers, usually without much result. There have been big scores made from time-to-time, however.\n\nPlaven briefly came to the attention of the Imperial authorities in 1093, when it was discovered that a group of criminals specialising in starship-borne raids on isolated communities along the frontier were using the world as a base. Although the loot obtained by raiding minor targets is minimal, the risks are also very small, so what are sometimes referred to as ‘space-going poultry thieves’ sometimes engage in such activity between more lucrative operations. Be that as it may, the band using a valley high in the Varnis Mountains as a base evaded capture for a long time before finally being eliminated in an action by Imperial Navy and marine assets.\n\nAfter that, Plaven more or less fell off the radar once again, although Imperial patrols from Quar and vessels from the Zhodani Consular Navy occasionally sweep the system. This is infrequent enough that patrols rarely encounter one another. When they do, polite but guarded communications exchanges are normally made before the vessels go about their own business. Harassment and similar ‘cold war’ tactics are avoided to reduce the chance of another accidental war.",
