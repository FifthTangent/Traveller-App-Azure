    "raw": "The Third Imperium was founded in Year 0 and expanded quickly at first. After the end of the Pacification Campaigns, this changed and the Imperium as an entity was no longer concerned with expansion. It was entirely willing to accept new members, and for corporations and other bodies to launch expeditions beyond its borders, but the initial deliberate expansion had been replaced by a gradual ‘border creep’.\n\nExpansion to coreward was curtailed by the Vargr Extents, a large area filled with small states and independent worlds with mostly Vargr populations. Major states were encountered in most other directions, or rifts created natural barriers. However, there was a narrow corridor between the coreward end of the Great Rift and the Vargr extents, and through this bottleneck the Imperium gradually expanded into the region beyond. This area is often referred to as lying behind the claw, as the shape of the Great Rift resembles a lobster claw.\n\nWhen they began exploring, early Imperial scouts found an underpopulated region that eventually led to the Sword Worlds and Darrian Confederations. These two small but developed powers lay close together, islands in a sea of unclaimed worlds. Before meeting them, however, the Imperial scouts ran into the Zhodani in Year 50. Initial contact was tentative and it was some time before the scale of the Consulate was appreciated.\n\nAfter establishing a forward base at Deneb, the scouts pushed on to open up the region and behind them came traders and colonists. In the region around Deneb itself, to trailing of the Marches, expansion was rapid and many colonies received considerable investment, resulting in the creation of several economically important worlds. Movement into the Marches was slower and made in piecemeal fashion.\n\nOne of the biggest developments for the Marches was the establishment of a trading settlement at Mora. Set up by Ling Standard Products in Year 60, this was initially the far end of a long trade route through Corridor and Deneb. Over the years, it gradually developed into a forward base for trade with the new colonies of the Marches and the states encountered there.\n\nContact with the Sword Worlds was in 73, but it was not until 148 that the Darrians met the Imperials. During this time, the Sword Worlds managed to create a new unified government, the Triple Dominion (shared by Anduril, Colada and Dyrnwyn), which lasted from 104 to 217. It may be that the Sword Worlders deliberately discouraged the Imperials from moving through their territory and thus meeting their Darrian rivals. Certainly, the number of scouting missions in that direction dropped rapidly.\n\nBy 200, Imperial interest in new territory, especially in distant regions that were hard to reach, had waned. Expansion in the Marches proceeded in a disjointed manner, fuelled by economics and on a small scale. The presence of the Spinward Main enabled easy access to large parts of the sector but the remainder was largely ignored and there was little interest in pushing beyond, even to spinward or rimward where there were open borders. To coreward, the Zhodani Consulate blocked further expansion.\n\nIn 250, the Imperium had spread into those parts of the sector easily reachable via the Spinward Main, bypassing less accessible regions. Regina, settled as early as 75, became a major trade centre, acting as a hub for half a dozen neighbouring worlds. By 250, this number had grown to 17, although some were very minor colonies. Expansion slowed further as easily-reached worlds were taken. Colonies grew into independent world-states in their own right and the region developed a respectable economy. However, backwaters remained exactly that; few new colonies were founded in most parts of the sector.\n\nWar\n--\nBy 500, tensions with the Consulate were rising as Imperial expansion, although slow, had resulted in Imperial and Zhodani colonies being intermingled along the border. After a period of escalating tensions, war broke out in 589. The conflict took the form of skirmishing along the border and deep raids into the sector against the main Imperial worlds. The Imperial Navy was caught at less than full readiness and the Zhodani formed the first Outworld Coalition with Vargr states in the Gvurrdon sector.\n\nEventually, the Imperials were able to force a stalemate and the subsequent armistice, enacted in 604, ended what is now known as the First Frontier War. The Imperium lost territory but was compensated with ownership of large unclaimed areas of the sector. Had the Zhodani wanted these systems, they had had centuries to take them unopposed, so this was an easy concession for them to make.\n\nThe Imperial commander in the Marches, Grand Admiral Olav hault-Plankwell, was deeply disgusted at the lack of support he had received during the war. Desperately needed reinforcements were not released from other sector fleets despite Plankwell’s entreaties. When they finally arrived, the reinforcements were enough to force a stalemate, after which Plankwell used them for another purpose.\n\nWith a fleet at his back, Plankwell advanced on Capital, assassinated Empress Jacqueline and took the Iridium Throne for himself. This began the Civil War, during which a series of emperors ruled for brief periods. These Emperors of the Flag or Barracks Emperors were almost all naval commanders who defeated the last claimant only to fall in battle themselves.\n\nWhile the Civil War was raging, the Outworld Coalition reformed and struck again, in 615. The Second Frontier War, which lasted until 620, was characterised by a brilliant, if rather desperate, holding action orchestrated by Grand Admiral Arbellatra Alkhalikoi, coupled with raids by Imperial cruiser forces into enemy territory. Benefiting from a crash-building programme to replace losses incurred in the Frontier and Civil wars, Arbellatra fought the Outworld Coalition to a bloody standstill. She unilaterally negotiated an armistice that ceded more Imperial territory to the Zhodani and, as Plankwell before her, advanced on Capital.\n\nThe Second Frontier War ended in 620 and, in 622, Grand Admiral Arbellatra reached Capital and defeated the fleet of Emperor Gustus. Rather than simply take the crown, she appointed herself regent, holding the throne in trust until the Imperial Moot could settle the matter of succession. Arbellatra was made Regent in 622 and crowned Emperor by the Moot in 629, ending the Civil War and beginning the modern dynasty\n\nThese events stripped the Marches of its fleet but there was no resumption of hostilities with the Zhodani for many years. Indeed, it was not until 979 that conflict broke out once again. There had been incidents, and even a few skirmishes, in the intervening time and tensions had been rising for some years.\n\nDespite this, the Imperial response was disjointed and, overall, inadequate. The war mainly took the form of commerce raiding by cruisers while the battle fleets of both sides faced off but did little. The Navy and Emperor himself were censured for their lack of activity and, eventually, in 986 a peace agreement was reached. The terms were unfavourable to the Imperium and this, coupled with general disaffection over the way the war was prosecuted, resulted in the abdication of Emperor Styryx.\n\nThe settlement eliminated problematical border regions and allowed a good defensive frontier to be set-up in accordance with the ‘thin hard crust’ strategy then in use. This strategic model called for a forward defensive zone to be held as strongly as possible but was replaced by a more flexible system of defence in depth.\n\nPeace returned to the Marches, although elsewhere the Solomani Rim War distracted Imperial attention. Then, in 1082, the Fourth Frontier War erupted. This conflict was triggered by an unintentional incident and took the form of a series of naval battles along the frontier. It was over quickly; peace was made in 1084, before the Emperor’s orders for conduct of the war or any significant reinforcements reached the Marches. Again, there was some slight realignment of borders.\n\nSince the end of the False War, as it is sometimes known, the region has existed in relative peace. There are troubles on various worlds, the occasional Imperial intervention or trade war between corporations and so forth, but there are no indications that major troubles are brewing.",
