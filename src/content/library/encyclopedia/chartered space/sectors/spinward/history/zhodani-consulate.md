Over the next tens of thousands of years, the Zhodani struggled to survive an ice age triggered by the bombardment and, as conditions improved, began to spread out across the planet. By approximately -24000 (by the modern Imperial calendar), the Zhodani had evolved into their modern form and became increasingly reliant on agriculture rather than nomadic hunting. 

Imperial scientists believe that there was once a large population of Chirpers on Zhdant. They might have been put there by the Ancients or could have been native. In either case, human contact resulted in the discovery that these Chirpers had psionic abilities. Zhodani humans may or may not have gained their initial insight into psionics from the Chirper population; what is known is that from the time humans and Chirpers encountered one another, Zhodani humans began to display psionic abilities. 

Zhodani sources are vague about the Chirpers; they all died out during recorded history. There is also evidence that around -8000, the Zhodani suffered massive depopulation, probably due to a plague. There may be a connection between these events.

Civilisation was rebuilt slowly and not without difficulty. However, by -6731 a technological society existed on Zhdant. This was the date of the first Psionic Games, the beginning of modern Zhodani society. The Psionic Games established a path for a psionically talented commoner to join the nobility and helped find the most powerful psionic individuals in each generation. The period between games (three local years) is still a fundamental concept in Zhodani society.

The Zhodani are thought to have begun (some sources say regained, which has interesting implications) space travel around -6400. Within 400 years, they were launching sublight exploration missions to neighbouring systems. The Zhodani were willing to undertake very long-term operations; they created colonies in several systems and sent out exploration ships on missions lasting decades. The Zhodani Consulate was founded in -5823 and comprised worlds as far as four parsecs from Zhdant.

In -5415 the Zhodani developed jump drive technology and rapidly expanded their territory, encountering sentient species along the way. They met the Vargr around -2800 and the Vilani in about -2000. However, Zhodani exploration was unusual in one very significant way; they were fascinated by the galactic core.

Since -4000, the Zhodani have launched seven major, and many more minor, Core Expeditions. These have gradually pushed towards the galactic core, establishing a chain of refuelling and repair bases, and establishing relations with species met along the way. 

The expeditions are limited to a region of about 30 parsecs wide, with occasional offshoots, and extend over 8,000 parsecs. Imperial scientists do not know the purpose of these missions but suggest, given the time and expense involved, they must be considered very important. 

The Zhodani Consulate expanded rapidly from -4000 to -1000, at which point it halted. Unlike the Imperium, there is no ‘border creep’; the Consulate has been stable for two thousand years. According to the Zhodani, it has reached the largest size that can be effectively governed and further expansion is both unnecessary and counterproductive.

Although it holds a few worlds in the Spinward Marches, the Zhodani Consulate did not push into the sector and thus had a stable border when later arrivals appeared on the scene.
