It seems that the Ancients were active in the Spinward Marches, as is evidenced by the transplanted Terran species; various animals and plants native to Terra and other distant worlds were found in the region when human exploration began. There were also humans living in the area; the Daryen people, for one, and the rather more powerful Zhodani.

There are also some interesting anomalies. Several Ancients sites and many artefacts have been located, and the Ancients are thought to have been somehow responsible for Shionthy being an asteroid belt; there is strong evidence that it was a planet until, in cosmological terms, quite recently.

However, little is known about ancient times in the Marches. Archaeologists uncover new data from timeto-time but the work is intermittent and piecemeal. Evidence has been found of non-human civilisations dating from the distant past but which are not thought to be associated with the Ancients. Perhaps time and research will make this clearer.

In the meantime, it is known that the Ancients were here at some point and they did a number of things that suggest a lengthy stay. They are gone now. Beyond that, everything is a matter for conjecture. 

Information about the Zhodani is hard to come by and not always reliable, but it seems they arrived on their homeworld (Zhdant) about 300,000 years ago. They were brought from Terra by the Ancients, who settled them and undertook a range of incomprehensible acts including remodelling mountains and cutting, then refilling, ocean trenches. They also reportedly built a city on the moon of Zhdant.

Soon afterwards, perhaps as little as a few hundred years, Zhdant came under severe orbital bombardment. It is thought that the Ancient cities and other sites were destroyed using several hundred megatons of nuclear explosives, as well as deadfall ordnance (objects dropped from orbit as kinetic weapons) and other unidentified weapons. Modern Zhodani are descended from a few tens of thousands of survivors, who were cast back to barbarism. There are no records of survivors among the Ancients.

The Marches Today
--
The Spinward Marches of today, in the year 1105 since the founding of the Third Imperium, are the product of great and small events, the distant and more recent past continuing to influence the present with many initiatives and movements afoot. Some are overt, some hidden and some a combination of both. The consequences of some of these actions cannot be predicted even by their instigators. Whatever else may be true, the Marches of 1105 are an interesting place.
