Meanwhile, another transplanted group of humans was becoming active in the region. Like the Zhodani, the Darrians were settled on a habitable world by the Ancients, for reasons unknown, and then abandoned when the Ancients departed. Darrian was a very habitable world and there was less impetus to develop technology than elsewhere. The Darrians developed slowly and peacefully.

Many centuries later, in -1520, while the Rule of Man was declining into the Long Night, a fleet of ships belonging to a Terran corporation arrived at Darrian, seeking a new home. They befriended the Darrians rather than competing with them, and by -1400 a synthesis of the two cultures emerged. This had the best features of both groups; the energy and inquisitiveness of the Terrans, fused with the intellectual nature of the Darrians to create a technologically advanced yet ethical society. 

They were capable of interbreeding and within 400 years there was only one Darrian race and culture. Moreover, it possessed TL16 technology – higher than the Imperium itself. However, this was the Darrians’ undoing. They began to experiment on Tanis, Darrian’s sun, in -1000 and in -924 the star destabilised. 

It is thought that the event known as Mahgiz (Chaos, in the Darrian language), was caused by an experimental probe sent into the star, causing a series of massive solar flares to erupt. These were accompanied by a huge electromagnetic pulse (EMP), which radiated out from the star at lightspeed.

The pulse did no physical damage but destroyed electronics. At a stroke, factories, hospitals, businesses and starships lost their electronics systems. Vehicles crashed, automated systems went out of control and communications disappeared. The pulse was followed by a wavefront of stellar gas moving more slowly and, three weeks after the EMP, Darrian was devastated by fire from space, which killed over 80% of the population and effectively destroyed civilisation on the planet.

Although the gas dissipated in the Darrian system, the EMP struck other systems as it radiated outwards. With some warning, it was possible to preserve electronic systems from the worst effect but the heart had been torn out of the Darrian civilisation. Without the technology and industry of the homeworld, there was no way to replace or maintain technological items, such as the starships possessed by the Darrian colonies.

In -905, the Darrians began taking measures to ensure long-term survival. Starships were placed in storage and each colony looked inward, preparing to survive the difficult times ahead. By -860, the Darrians had ceased all space travel.

Over the next six centuries the world of Mire gradually climbed back up to TL10 and began constructing starships. Its cache of surviving vessels were refurbished and the Darrians returned to the stars. In -275 they began exploring nearby space. What they found was both surprising and ominous
