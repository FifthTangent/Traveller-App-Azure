Grant is habitable but is interdicted (and therefore a Red Zone) by the Imperial Interstellar Scout Service for undisclosed reasons. It is commonly believed that the IISS interdicts worlds to protect inhabitants or prevent visitors from coming to harm, while the Navy does so for strategic or political reasons. If this is true, Grant may have an indigenous species species that needs to be protected, although there are the usual wild claims of ancient alien ruins and hidden research bases. One persistent rumour is that the Imperium is quietly building a city on Grant, perhaps as a retreat for highvalue personnel or as a large-scale social experiment. No proof has emerged but the regular presence of Navy ships enforcing the blockade makes many observers wonder if something is happening on Grant beyond the usual Scout Service interdict-to-protect rationale
