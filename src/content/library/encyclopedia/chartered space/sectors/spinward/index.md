To the average citizen of the Imperial core worlds, the Spinward Marches is just a name, one of the distant provinces perhaps, or one of those troublesome backward border regions. Certainly, nothing good ever seems to come out of the Marches. The Civil War was launched from there; major conflicts with foreign states are two-a-Credit… and, in any case, the Marches are on the other side of the Great Rift, very far away and of no real consequence.

There is an element of truth in this. The Marches are isolated not only by distance but by the barrier of the Great Rift, which cannot be crossed without considerable effort. As a result, the only way into, and out of, the Marches is through the narrow Imperial-held strip between the Great Rift and Vargr Extents, aptly named the Corridor sector.

On top of that, the Spinward Marches is the Imperial border with the Zhodani Consulate and several smaller human, Vargr and other states. As a result, it was bound to have an interesting history. Most events in the Marches affect only the local area but, occasionally, something spills out, usually something bad – that is just how the universe works.

To a great extent, astrography dictates many of the characteristics of the sector. The single most important feature is the Spinward Main, which wends its way right across the sector, branching at several points. The Spinward Main is often considered to begin at Mora; in fact the chain of stars runs onward into the Star Lane subsector of Deneb for a couple of parsecs.

From Mora, an arm of the Main runs coreward into Rhylanor but the Main proper is far longer. One of the major arms run coreward into Aramis and Regina, then across spinward all the way to Querion. The central arm runs through the Sword Worlds to Darrian, while the rimward arm splits into three major branches. One leads to Glisten and two run into the Five Sisters.

The most important implication of this huge astrographical feature is that it is possible to reach any subsector of the Marches with a jump-1 ship, albeit slowly. A jump-2 ship can reach almost any world in the sector by following the Main then jumping across onto a smaller main. Only a handful of worlds cannot be reached in this way.

There are a few areas of very sparse systems in the Marches, which tend to channel and restrict shipping. One is in Aramis but lies close to the border so has little effect on internal shipping. Rather more important is the sparse area in the Vilis and Lanth subsectors. Not only is this a region of low stellar density, which restricts easy navigation, but it is associated with a number of curious phenomena; the incidence of misjumps and ship disappearances in what is known as the Abyss Rift is significantly higher than in other areas. The region of sparse systems extends out to spinward from Vilis but, as there is no Imperial territory in this direction, it is of little consequence. 

The other region of low stellar density lies to spinward-coreward of Collace, in District 268, and is known as the Collace Rift. Arms of the Spinward Main run around the edges of this rift, which contains the barelysurveyed world designated 875-496 and the interdicted Droyne worlds of Andor and Candory.

Politically, there are few barriers to navigation in most of the sector. The Sword Worlds Confederation is not friendly to the Imperium, which necessitates a detour around Sword Worlder space for most ships headed to the Darrian Confederation. Difficulty of access also means that Imperial holdings in the Five Sisters are more or less cut off from the rest of the Imperium.

Obviously, crossing the border into the Zhodani Consulate presents significant problems, as Imperial ships are not always welcomed there, and the same applies to the Sword Worlds Confederation. Ships coming into the Imperium from these states are sometimes considered suspect by the Imperial Navy and the worlds they visit.

However, the Imperial border is not a hard barrier. It is simple enough to leave Imperial space, visit worlds outside the Imperium, and later return, and no special permissions are needed. While the Imperium has laws that govern trade between member worlds, these do not apply to systems outside the Imperium and those systems have their own regulations. Thus, although crossing the border is easy, the way ships are treated by local authorities when they make planetfall can be a disincentive to cross-border trading.

Above all, it is important to note that each world, whether part of the Imperium or not, is different and self-governing. The Imperium is a framework that establishes common concepts and laws, and otherwise leaves worlds to their own devices, so there are large cultural differences between many of the worlds of the Imperium. Beyond its borders this is even more pronounced, although only the most isolated worlds are not affected in some way by the values and ideas that exist elsewhere in the universe
