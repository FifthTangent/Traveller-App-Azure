The Federation of Arden does not, technically, exist. Arden is one of several independent worlds lying between the Imperial/Zhodani border that have been influenced by both powers over the centuries. In recent years, Arden has proposed a local defence association among nearby worlds with a view to creating a formal alliance neutral to both Zhodani and Imperial interests.

Although this idea has not been met with great enthusiasm, a number of political pressure groups, businesses and minor shipping lines have recently begun making a lot of noise about a Federation of Arden. Exactly what is meant by this term depends on who is using it. It is often used to describe a loose alliance of businesses and groups attached to the political coat-tails of Arden.

There are those who predict that some kind of trade or even military alliance may emerge in time. This would require other governments to sign up, which does not seem imminently likely. It is probable that the whole thing is just talk but the Federation of Arden has now passed into common use in the surrounding region. Time will tell what form the Federation eventually takes.
