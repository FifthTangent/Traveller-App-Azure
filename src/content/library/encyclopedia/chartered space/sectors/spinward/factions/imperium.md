# The Imperium In The Spinward Marches
The majority of worlds in the Spinward Marches are members of the Third Imperium and Imperial corporations, officials from various services such as the Bureaucracy and members of the armed forces are common. Navy patrols are also a common occurrence, especially in systems on a major trade route.

Beyond the Imperial border, corporations are still active, although less so, and the Navy makes sweeps into neutral space. The Scout Service is also very active outside the Imperium. Local corporations and businesses, whether based in the Imperium or just outside it, often operate across the border without much regard to whether a world is part of the Imperium or not. Local regulations vary considerably and matter more than the allegiance of the world.

In this respect the border is a ‘soft’ one, in that although worlds on the border conduct customs checks like any other, they have no obligation to treat trans-border shipping differently to that coming from within the Imperium. As always, local conditions vary and some worlds choose to impose taxes on cross-border goods that would not be permitted under free-trade laws within the Imperium. This is a local matter and of no interest to Imperial authorities, so long as internal trade is not affected.

## Nobility
There is no Archduke, as there is no domain structure for the Marches to be part of. If there were, it would be the Domain of Deneb and probably administered by one of the sector dukes from more developed regions closer to the Imperial core, who would accordingly be granted the title of Archduke.

The Marches have the usual system of Imperial nobility in place, with individual worlds represented by barons or marquises and larger groupings administered by an Imperial count answering to the subsector duke. The position of Sector Duke, the most senior of the subsector dukes, which grants additional powers and responsibilities over the entire sector, is not officially assigned in the Marches.

However, the importance of Mora as a trade centre and the ‘Gateway to the Marches’ grants it, and the associated subsector, unmatched importance and so the role of Sector Duke is carried out semi-officially by Duchess Delphine of Mora. This practice has been in place for centuries by Delphine’s ancestors and is commonly accepted as the way things should be. Only those politically opposed to Delphine herself even question her primacy. She makes a point of not using the title of Sector Duke, although many of her supporters unofficially apply it.

Although the Marches remains something of an undeveloped backwater, it is also a frontier region and one that has historically been troubled by threats major and minor. As a result, many nobles maintain larger household forces (huscarles) than is common practice elsewhere in the Imperium. These forces are still not, for the most part, enormous and mostly consist of a patrol vessel or two and/or a battalion-sized light infantry force.

Some nobles, notably Duke Norris of Regina, maintain considerable forces. Duke Norris has a distinguished background in the Imperial Navy and remains dedicated to protecting the frontier from whatever threats emerge. Some would call him paranoid but his personal forces have more than once been the first-response formations in a crisis and have a good record. Among them is a unit also known as the 4518th Lift Infantry (Duke Norris’ Own Huscarles), raised by the duke as part of his personal forces but spends most of its time on loan to the Imperial Army.

Other nobles also loan part of their personal forces to the Imperial Army or ships to the Colonial Fleet, in the same way that many world governments do, although this practice is rare even in the Marches.

Among the other notable members of the nobility in the Marches is Leonard Fratelli Bolden-Tukera, Marquis of Aramis. Although ‘merely’ a marquis associated with a single world, his association with the powerful Tukera family gives him great power. The Tukera family are the founders of Tukera Lines, one of the Imperial megacorporations, and remain principal shareholders.

Although Tukera, like most megacorporations, has only a limited interest in the Marches, this translates to a large number of ships passing through the bigger ports and a very large amount of money changing hands. Thus far, Tukera’s interests are to not push far into the sector but there are rumours of investment in starports, which surely implies an expansion of the firm’s operations.

## Military
The Spinward Marches is defended by the Spinward Marches Sector Fleet of the Imperial Navy under the command of Sector Admiral Santanocheev, who is based at Mora. Unusually, there is no depot system in the Marches. Instead, the Sector Fleet’s major battle squadrons are usually deployed far forward at bases in the Regina, Vilis, Lanth and Lunion subsectors, with a strategic reserve in Trin and Mora.

Cruiser forces are similarly deployed for the most part, although a significant number are based further back to counter raids like those of the Third Frontier War. Support vessels, such as tankers, are mainly deployed in the rearward bases along with a fair proportion of the sector fleet’s destroyer strength.

Light vessels such as escorts are largely deployed with the major battle squadrons, the remainder dispersed throughout the sector for patrol and security work. In this capacity, they back up the larger numbers of light vessels available to subsector commands.

Two semi-independent commands exist. One is the Darrian Squadron, a small force deployed to the Darrian Confederation as a gesture of solidarity. The other is rather larger and includes an entire BatRon (Battleship squadRon), albeit of older capital ships and several cruisers, and is based in the Five Sisters. Its responsibility is to maintain the interdiction of the Droyne worlds at Andor and Candory, and launch the occasional sweep spinward or rimward of Imperial territory.

This somewhat dispersed deployment has been criticised but there are justifications, one being maintenance of a fierce face to deter aggression. There is also a perceived need to meet any incursion far forward to prevent a repeat of the Third Frontier War, in which the Navy was censured for its perceived lack of activity. There are those who fear these deployments are motivated too much by politics rather than military reality but their protests, despite being repeatedly made at the court of Duchess Delphine, have not been heeded.

Every subsector that contains Imperial worlds has a subsector fleet assigned to it, numbered rather than named. For example, the Imperial 193rd Fleet is based at Frenzie and responsible for the defence and security of the Vilis subsector.

The strength of the subsector fleets varies considerably. Most are built around a core consisting of a cruiser or carrier as flagship, a squadron or two of destroyers and a varying number of escorts and patrol ships. Technically, the subsector fleet also contains system squadrons of worlds that possess them, along with the security and defence squadrons assigned to naval bases. However, since these are not normally capable of leaving their home system, they usually devolve to local control.

The subsector fleets are assigned a mix of vessels supposedly adequate to meet patrol, security and defensive needs within their area of operations but, in practice, there are always too few vessels, and subsector admirals continually ask for reinforcements or assistance from Sector Command. Numbers are also made up by Colonial Fleet vessels, which include Scout Service ships and a few minor combatants on loan from nobles or world governments.

In time of war, some subsector commands could expect to receive cruisers or battleships transferred from Sector Command or deployed as reinforcements in important subsectors. ‘Fortress’ worlds with their own powerful forces provide for their own defence but the rest of the subsector would be vulnerable until the Sector Fleet could drive invaders out.

A significant marine force is maintained at naval bases for deployment at need. These forces are under Navy command and operate in conjunction with naval assets. Imperial Army formations, on the other hand, have an independent command structure.

Like the Navy, the Imperial Army maintains local headquarters in each subsector with a sector headquarters at Mora. Major Army forces, including aerospace and orbital defence formations, are deployed to critical worlds along the frontier, while the remainder are based further back. Detachments are deployed throughout the sector on missions as varied as internal security, counterinsurgency and peacekeeping roles.

There is always conflict going on somewhere, or else a need for Army personnel to assist in disaster-relief operations. For the most part, however, these are minor operations and the Army as a whole is on a peacetime footing.

## Shipping and Communications
Information and goods both move in much the same manner, carried along major trade routes between larger ports then spreading out to worlds along ‘feeder’ routes, usually aboard smaller ships as distance from the major routes increases. This is adequate for routine cargo but priority items and important messages are often sent aboard small, fast courier ships that cannot make a profit from standard-rate bulk shipping but charge a higher fee for fast or secure service.

Most large organizations, corporations, Imperial services, and armed forces, tend to maintain their own courier network. As a rule, information moves along the x-boat routes at a theoretical maximum speed of jump-4 and, on average, somewhat slower. Dedicated high-jump couriers deliver critical information faster, although at an appropriately high price – jump-6 couriers are not cheap.

Non-urgent and civilian communications across the Marches are carried in several ways. The express boat (x-boat) network carries routine messages in electronic format between x-boat stations, from where the information spreads like ripples on a pond. Scout Service vessels and commercial couriers carry mail dumps, duplicates of all electronic media to arrive in the past few weeks, to nearby worlds on a regular basis. This means that any given message arrives several times, ensuring that a problem with a ship or data packet simply means a delay rather than loss of data.

Worlds that receive few vessels can be weeks or even months behind the times. The story of a world that does not know the Fourth Frontier War has ended yet is apocryphal but backwater systems do not get updates very often.

Physical mail and freight can be even less common on some worlds. Many small merchant vessels supplement their income as ‘mail ships’, which simply means having a dedicated cargo area made available for small packages intended for destination worlds. If there are none, the mail space is used for other purposes. Many worlds are part of postal unions that have a dedicated mail ship (or several) plying between them, ensuring electronic mail arrives in a timely fashion and physical items reach their destination sooner or later.

Ships are sometimes chartered to take cargo to a specific destination, or a collection of incidentals will be placed in a standard container and shipped at normal freighting rates whenever a vessel is headed in the right direction. This occasionally results in a vessel delivering a 1-ton shipping container that holds only a few small items. It is of no concern to the vessel operator whether the container is full or not; the fee for carrying it is the same.

The other way that goods move around is through speculative trading on the part of shipowners. Rather than take a cargo in return for a flat fee, a ship operator may decide to buy goods at one port and sell them at another, hoping for a profit. Shipping empty hold space is expensive, so even goods that do not cover these costs are better than carrying nothing.

Exploratory trade is a special case of speculative trade. In this case, a speculative cargo is taken into an area in order to investigate its trade potential. New markets opened in this way can be very lucrative but risks are high; there is no guarantee of selling the cargo at all. Exploratory trade is the province of specialist trade scouts and the occasional free trader captain gripped by entrepreneurial spirit.

## Megacorporations
Megacorporations are active in the Spinward Marches; indeed, it was LSP that first set up a trade base at Mora and paved the way for expansion into the sector. Corporate freighters belonging to Delgado and Tukera run into Mora and then up the Spinward Main, although on the whole smaller ships are used for runs deeper into the Marches.

Exceptions include the major lines through to Lunion, Trin and Glisten, and coreward towards Rhylanor and Regina. These runs are plied by big megacorporate freighters and liners as well as smaller ships.

The financial corporations are active wherever there is a need for investment and those with mining interests (notably LSP and Sternmetal Horizons) have facilities on several mainworlds, outsystem planets and planetoid belts. Similarly, trade and commerce exist everywhere, although many areas of the Marches are not worth megacorporate interest; they simply do not offer enough return.

Instellarms has major facilities in the Marches, offering weaponry to governmental, corporate and mercenary clients. Its regional headquarters is at Mora but many major worlds have an office or other facilities.

As a rule, the megacorporations can be encountered wherever it is worth their while to operate. Low-tech and low-population worlds are not good prospects and nor are hard-to-reach places. Thus, the big firms are mainly restricted to major worlds with good communications links to the rest of the Imperium. This creates a niche for smaller corporations and minor firms, including freelance outfits, to make a profit in the gaps between the major players’ fields of interest.

# Psionics Institutes
Officially, all research into psionics and the teaching and use of psionic talents were prohibited three centuries ago. All overt schools of psionics were closed down, psi-drug corporations forced to end production and psionics use in the Imperium more or less came to an end.

It is an open secret that the Imperium continues to conduct research in order to counter the use of psionic powers by foreign agents (such as the Zhodani) or illegal users. It is also widely believed that psionic skills are still taught in underground psionics institutes.

Exactly what constitutes an institute varies from one case to the next. Some are academic in nature, operating quietly on the fringes of society or under the guise of more legitimate activities. Others are secret societies, crazy old hermits or other oddball characters who teach their skills to an apprentice. All of these ‘institutes’ have one thing in common – they are illegal and unregulated. There is no guarantee that what appears to be a source of psionic training is not a scam, con, cover for something else, or a genuinely crazy person. It might even be something quite sinister like a cult.

Even where psionics training is genuinely available, it may be flawed or incomplete. Three centuries of underground teaching has resulted in some serious misconceptions and there is no recourse if an individual’s quest for training ends badly.

This does not stop individuals seeking such training. Most find nothing or come to the attention of the authorities and are discouraged from continuing. Others land themselves in trouble by poking around in underworlds where they assume an institute can be found, or waste large amounts of time and money visiting obscure places, which are potentially dangerous. It is entirely possible to starve to death or be killed by wildlife searching the outback of a frontier world for an institute that ceased to exist centuries ago

There are, however, sources of psionic training for those able to find them. Each is very different and the chances of finding one that teaches all disciplines is remote, to say the least. For the psionicist seeking to develop their full potential, the quest for knowledge and teachers is liable to be a lifetime challenge.

# Research Stations 
The Imperium maintains a number of research installations in the Marches. Most are mundane laboratories in cities of high-population, high-tech worlds, where the staff go home to very ordinary lives at the end of the day. Others are corporate laboratories on contract to the Imperium or military facilities located at army or naval bases.

Most do important but unexciting work, such as developing improved targeting software for naval applications or pushing the envelope of gravitic technology to wring an extra tenth of a percent efficiency out of gravitic systems. However, there are a number of less ordinary installations that conduct highly secret research.

These installations are located in remote areas of inhabited planets or outsystem worlds, and designated by a Greek letter (such Research Station Gamma located on Vanejen in the Rhylanor subsector). Access is restricted; the surrounding area is normally considered a Red Zone and anyone visiting without a permit is liable to be arrested and punished for the violation. Lethal force is can be used against anyone declining to surrender.

The nature of research undertaken at these facilitates is highly classified. Most specialise in one area, but this is not always the case, and wild theories exist about what any given installation does. Most concern exciting subjects like psionics research, biochemical warfare and investigation of Ancients devices. All that is known for certain is that these installations are highly secure and that a lot of money is spent on them. Budgetary allocations are not available for scrutiny other than by a very select group of personnel within the Bureaucracy.

# Other Installations 
Other than military bases, scout service way stations, and research institutes, the Imperium has a number of installations within the Marches. Most are located at highports and major cities, such as embassies, administrative canters and recruiting offices for various forces and services. The Ministry of Justice also maintains a number of facilities ranging from training canters to prisons.

The latter tend not to be large. Worlds handle their own law enforcement and punishment of offenders, and the Imperium only deals with Imperial felons. Most of the latter are guilty of extremely serious crimes, which may carry the death penalty. These hardcore prisoners are detained in extremely high-security installations on asteroids, in remote areas or aboard prison hulks created by gutting a surplus starship of its drives and weapons. Less dangerous perpetrators of significant crimes, such as large-scale embezzlement, are also detained in these installations.

Despite a number of accusations and entertainment shows on the subject, the Imperium does not have hundreds of prison hulks filled with political prisoners scattered throughout the Marches. There are relatively few Imperial felonies meriting incarceration in an installation of this kind. The sort of people sent to them are those considered far too dangerous to be dealt with in any other way, or else those with a penchant for escaping custody or evading punishment and who therefore require special treatment. The cost of supporting these installations is considerable, so they are only used when necessary.
