There are no Aslan worlds in the Marches but there are Aslan populations on several. Some are integrated into the local population (such as in the Darrian Confederation) while others remain aloof in their own settlements. Some are present legally and with the blessings of the world government; some are squatters who have simply grabbed land, a common practice among Aslan ihatei, or ‘second sons’. Aslan males value land ownership very highly but only the primary heir inherits. Some males are happy to serve their clan in a subordinate role. The ihatei are the others; those who have set out to make their own fortune.

Ihatei settlements sometimes trade in goods or services, with several worlds having units of Aslan mercenaries as part of their planetary armed forces. Others are simply armed camps whose inhabitants just want to be left alone and are prepared to repel any attempt to interfere with their plans.

Aslan society is very male-dominated, with females taking supporting roles as managers, technicians and scientists while the males are pilots, soldiers and leaders. This can make them difficult to deal with but, in many ways, Aslan are easier to get along with than Sword Worlders.

Aslan have a strict culture of duty and honour, and can be insulted very easily by those that do not understand their ways. Some Aslan are more understanding about the cultural ignorance of outsiders but the basics of Aslan etiquette (enough not to get into serious trouble) can be quickly picked up, enabling interaction with Aslan without being challenged to a duel.

Aslan trade ships and mercenary units are common in the Marches, with ihatei settlements restricted mainly to the spinward-rimward corner of the sector. Individuals and small groups have settled on many worlds and are unlikely to attract comment from most Imperial governments.
