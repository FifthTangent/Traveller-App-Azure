The Zhodani Consulate is the largest non-Imperial power with an interest in the Marches. Its holdings are small, confined to a couple of subsectors along the spinward-coreward edge of the sector, but the influence of the Consulate reaches much further into the sector than this.

Zhodani military ships are unlikely to be encountered in Imperial territory except as escorts for consulate officials or valuable cargoes. They are occasionally active in neutral areas and routinely transit a narrow corridor through Imperial space to the Sword Worlds for ‘diplomatic purposes’. Access is permitted by treaty for a small tonnage of vessels each year with the Imperial Navy shadowing the Zhodani vessels during transit.

Zhodani merchants and couriers are seen somewhat more often, and range more widely, but as a rule they tend to stay out of Imperial space. There is a persistent theory that the first three Frontier Wars (the fourth was an accident) were fought because the Zhodani felt threatened by the Imperium, and that if there is no perceived threat then there will be no more war or interaction. The Zhodani do not seem interested in what happens outside their own extensive borders.

There are those, of course, who take the opposite view. They contrast the lack of Zhodani ships in Imperial space with the way Imperial vessels routinely trade into the Vargr Extents and neutral space beyond, as well as into the Consulate itself, and suggest it is the ships they do not see that are the problem. There are also claims that the Consulate is sponsoring anti-Imperial sentiment within the Marches.

The Consulate is not inclined to comment on these matters. It maintains a strong naval and military presence along the border and is not receptive to Imperial vessels crossing into the Consulate. Permits are required and boardings are not uncommon. While vessels are not harassed, they are not welcomed either.

Exactly how negative an image this creates depends greatly on the outlook of the ship crew in question. Those who dislike the Zhodani speak of this lack of welcome as a deliberate attempt to discourage Imperials from entering the Consulate. Those with a more neutral viewpoint feel the Zhodani simply do not care one way or the other and that Imperial ships with the right paperwork are as welcome as any others.

It would be surprising if the Zhodani Consulate did not have intelligence gathering apparatus within Imperial space. The availability of psionic powers grants extra capabilities but most likely the Consulate uses a mundane system of agents, informants and couriers like other states. Its own counter-intelligence system seems to be very effective, when it works.

The rest of the time, Imperial agents in Zhodani space seem to be able to operate undiscovered. Asking why this might be leads to the conclusion that perhaps the Zhodani are content to leave most agents in place and only remove those who are troublesome.

The Zhodani Consulate has a maximum TL14 and enormous industrial power. The size of its fleets are unknown but, based on previous conflicts, they are likely to be huge. Certainly, large numbers of patrol craft have been sighted along the border and these seem to be very efficient.
