The majority of worlds and people in the Marches are part of the Imperium and are dealt with here. Note however that the Imperium is not a monolithic organisation; it has many power blocs and interest groups, some are aligned with external factions. Others are pursuing their own ends, which may not coincide with the best interests of the Imperium as a whole.
