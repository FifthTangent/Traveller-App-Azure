## Jack-of-All-Trades
The Jack-of-All-Trades skill works differently to other skills. It reduces the unskilled penalty a Traveller receives for not having the appropriate skill by one for every level of Jack-of-All-Trades.

_For example, if a Traveller does not have the Pilot skill, they suffer DM-3 to all Pilot checks. If that Traveller has Jack-of-All-Trades 2, then the penalty is reduced by 2 to DM-1. With Jack- of-All-Trades 3, a Traveller can totally negate the penalty for being unskilled._

There is no benefit for having Jack-of-All-Trades 0 or Jack-of-All-Trades 4 or more.

> Jack-of-All-Trades cannot be chosen during character creation, and must be rolled.
## Language
There are numerous different Language specialities, each one covering reading and writing a different language. All Travellers can speak and read their native language without needing the Language skill, and automated computer translator programs mean Language skills are not always needed on other worlds.
Having Language 0 implies the Traveller has a smattering of simple phrases in several languages.

#### Languages
- Galanglic: The common trade language of the Third Imperium, derived originally from the English spoken in the Rule of Man. 
- Vilani: The language spoken by the Vilani of the First Imperium; the ‘Latin’ of the Third Imperium.
- Zdetl: The Zhodani spoken language.
- Oynprith: The Droyne ritual language. 
- Trokh: The Aslan spoken language.
- Gvegh: The Vargr spoken language.

## Leadership 
The Leadership skill is for directing, inspiring and rallying allies and comrades. A Traveller may make a Leadership action in combat.

The Traveller can pass orders, commands and suggestions to comrades fighting on the same side. To do this, the Traveller makes a Leadership check. The Effect of this check is the number of Boons the Traveller can give to any skill checks (including attack rolls) to other Travellers on the same side. The Traveller must be able to freely communicate to another Traveller to grant a Boon. However, bad leadership can end a battle quicker than good leadership can win one. If the Effect of the Leadership check is negative, the opposing side may inflict several Banes equal to the Effect to combatants on the Traveller’s side.

The Mechanic skill allows a Traveller to maintain and repair most equipment. Some advanced equipment and spacecraft components require the Engineer skill.

## Melee 
The Melee skill covers attacking in hand-to-hand combat and the use of suitable weapons. The unarmed specialty represents all-round close quarters fighting ability. This might be a formally trained fighting system such as Ju-Jitsu or mixed martial arts or could be a familiarity with nasty grab-and-punch brawls. Other unarmed combat specialties are available, representing advanced capabilities in areas but leaving weaknesses in others.

**Unarmed**
Punching, kicking, and wrestling; using improvised weapons in a bar brawl.

**Unarmed Grapple**
This represents the ability to fight at extreme close quarters using wrestling, throwing, choking and joint-locking techniques. This may come from a formal system such as catch wrestling or Judo, or might simply be a combination of experience and nastiness.

A Traveller with the Grapple specialty gains no benefit from it other than when in a grappling situation. If a grapple has begun, the skilled grappler may inflict one point of extra damage per skill level any time  they hurts their opponent. They also treat their **effective Melee skill as twice their grapple specialty level** when wrestling with an opponent.

**Unarmed Striking**
This represents skill at delivering blows with the limbs. This might come from a formal system such as boxing or Karate, or could be nothing more than the ability to throw big swinging punches. A striker treats their Melee skill as 0 in a grapple unless they also have a specialty such as unarmed or grappling. However, they are more effective in an exchange of blows. A striker may add one point of damage per level of their striking specialty on any occasion they do damage with natural weapons, other than in a grapple.

**Bludgeon**
Attacking with maces, clubs, staves and so on.

**Blade**
Attacking with swords, rapiers, blades, and other edged weapons.

**Finesse Blades**
This represents skill with a narrow range of light blade weapons including the rapier, smallsword, and their sporting equivalents.

A fencer treats their Melee skill as 0 when using other weapons unless they have another specialty that covers their use, such as the more general Melee (blade).

**When fighting with a rapier or similar light bladed weapon, they treat their effective Melee skill as twice their Finesse specialty.**

## Profession 
A Traveller with a Profession skill is trained in producing useful goods or services. There are many different Profession specialties, but each one works the same way – the Traveller can make a Profession check to earn money on a planet that supports that trade. The amount of money raised is Cr250 x the Effect of the check per month. Unlike other skills with specialties, levels in the Profession skill do not grant the ability to use other specialties at level 0. Each specialty must be learned individually. Someone with a Profession skill of 0 has a general grasp of working for a living but little experience beyond the most menial jobs. 

There are a huge range of potential specialties for this skill, one for every possible profession in the universe. Some examples suitable to a science fiction setting are given here. Also note that on some worlds other skills, such as Animals or Computer, may be used to earn a living in the same manner as Profession skills.

Hiding a Vehicle:
	_Stealth check (1D minutes, DEX) opposed by Perception (INT) check, with a DM based on the size and conspicuousness of the vehicle._

_In situations where Travellers need to move stealthily or avoid being detected, an opposed check is used with Stealth versus Recon. This check can be modified by factors such as camouflage or sensors. Some sensors are so powerful that it is almost impossible to hide from them. However, thermal camouflage and other techniques can be used to conceal the user's heat signature or make it appear as something harmless._

_Modifiers are applied to the opposed Stealth versus Recon check to model the battle between sensors and camouflage systems. If the person trying to be stealthy has no counter to a sensor, they are likely to be automatically spotted, unless there are mitigating circumstances. Camouflage and sensors are rated in terms of DM, which is granted to a Stealth or Recon check._

_Once a shooter opens fire, observers will have a chance to spot the weapon discharge, and the Stealth versus Recon check applies once again when the shooter changes position._
