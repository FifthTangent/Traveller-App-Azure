Characters with Chef have learned the foundations of food preparation and transcended it to achieve attractive tastes and smells.

**Construction  
Fabrication**

A fabricator is concerned with the production of high-quality work output.

**Crew member**

This indicates a Traveller’s familiarity with the general tasks needed aboard a starship. Many decks crew aboard large ships do not have specific skills but simply add their labour to tasks such as maintenance, cleaning, cargo loading and shepherding passengers.

**Designer**

Designer is used in conjunction with other skills to create new objects: Designer plus Communications can be used to create a new design for a communicator (or to build one from components otherwise on hand). This can be made into further specializations such as Biologicals, Civil Engineering, or Polymers.

**Mining**

The Traveller will be familiar with the slang and standard procedures used by both corporate miners and those who live as belters. A belter will be familiar with the art and science of finding valuable deposits of ore, minerals, hydrocarbons, or other resources that can be extracted for use or to sell at a profit. They will also have at least some familiarities with the other aspects of prospecting, such as claims law, strike registry and so forth.

**Ranching**

Looking after the yards or flocks. This speciality has some overlap with the Animals skill, but deals more with tasks like rounding up cattle, slaughtering animals and ensuring the yards are safe from bad weather.

**Security**

Permits a Traveller to set up or defeat mechanical and electronic locks, and other means of passive security, and to spot alarms, traps or other passive measures intended to keep people away from valuables.

**Gun Smithing**

Gunsmithing is the art and science of designing, building, repairing, and modifying firearms.

**Welding**

Welding is the process of joining two or more pieces of metal by heating the surfaces to their melting points and fusing them together.

**Salvage**

Scrounging can be used to abstract a few petty thefts for subsistence purposes or to find a suitable component in a starship derelict floating amongst the stars. They will also have at least some familiarities with the other aspects of salvaging, such as claims law, registries and so forth.

**Robotics**

**Hunting**

The Profession (hunting) skill gives the Traveller in-depth knowledge of the techniques, equipment and weaponry used for hunting. Allow Travellers to use Profession (hunting) for checks or as a positive DM in hunting-related activities.

**_Social_**

**Sports**

The coaching and management of athletes, as well as sports administration and event coordination.

**Sales**

 The ability to sell products or services to customers.

**Marketing**

The ability to promote products or services to potential customers.

**Librarian**

A professional who manages a library and helps people find information.

**Pharmacologist**

Specialized in the study and development of drugs and medications.

**_Mechanic Professions_**

Skills that can be used in conjunction with other skills representing areas of specialization. Characters with these specializations are skilled in the maintenance, repair, and construction of devices using that technology.

**Fluidics**

Fluidics (Fluidic, Hydraulic) is concerned with devices based on fluid flow and interaction. Example fluidics devices include force amplifiers (based on hydraulics), pumps, and signal processors.

**Magnetics**

Magnetics (Magnetic) is concerned with devices based on magnetism and magnetic fields. Example magnetic devices include manipulators, sophisticated connectors, frictionless bearings, and sensors.

**Gravitics**

Gravitics (Gravitic) is concerned with devices based on gravity control. Example gravitics devices include lifters, grav plates, and inertial compensators.

**Photonics**

Photonics (Photonic) is concerned with devices and materials based on light, electromagnetic radiation, and photon flow. Photonics devices include those which emit or radiate photons externally (including radio frequency devices, lasers, and illuminators), or which make use of photon flow internally (as in fiber optics, photon cascades, and vision devices).

**_Hostile Environments_**

**Contaminant**

Used to avoid hazards originating from biological, chemical, or nuclear contamination. It grants the ability to spot potential hazards and decontaminate safely, but will not help if the Traveller is exposed to radiation or agents without protection. An insidious or tainted atmosphere count as ‘contamination’ in this sense.

Making a chemical spill safe:

_Average (8+) Profession (hostile environment/contaminant) check (3Dx5 minutes, EDU)_

**High-G**

Represents experience at operating in environments of 1.2g and upwards and is mainly used to avoid hazards or offset penalties imposed by the environment.

Staying conscious through an 8g turn aboard a combat jet:

_Difficult (10+) Profession (hostile environment/ high-g) check (1D seconds, END)_

**Low-G / Microgravity**

Represents experience at operating in environments of less than 0.2g and is mainly used to avoid hazards or offset penalties imposed by the environment. In addition, a Traveller may attack with a weapon that does 1D of damage for every level of their low-g skill without risking becoming disorientated. So, a Traveller with Profession (hostile environment/ low-g) 2 can use a weapon that does up to 2D damage (plus or minus points are ignored) without any risk of disorientation.

Moving through a tumbling starship with no working artificial gravity:

_Difficult (10+) Profession (hostile environment/low-g) check (3D seconds, DEX)_

**Underwater / Diving**

Represents experience at operating in aquatic environments, or when submerged in other fluids.

Searching a riverbed for valuables dropped in the water without stirring up the muddy bottom:

_Average (8+) Profession (hostile environment/underwater) check (2D minutes, DEX)._

**Extreme Heat**

Represents experience at operating in high temperature environments. It enables the Traveller to push through and endure the harsh environment.

**Extreme Cold**

Represents experience at operating in Low temperature environments. It enables the Traveller to push through and endure the harsh environment.

**Vacuum**   

Represents experience at operating in low or very low High-

**Altitude Operations**

Represents experience at operating in high-altitude environments, including knowledge of altitude sickness, hypoxia, and other hazards associated with high altitude. Atmosphere environments.

**Underground Operations**

Represents experience at operating in underground environments, including knowledge of cave systems, tunneling, and mining operations.

**Radiation**

Represents experience at operating in environments with dangerous levels of ionizing radiation, and the ability to detect and avoid sources of radiation.

**High Pressure**

Represents experience at operating in environments with high atmospheric pressure, and the ability to withstand and move in such environments.

**Low Pressure**

Represents experience at operating in environments with low atmospheric pressure, and the ability to withstand and move in such environments.
