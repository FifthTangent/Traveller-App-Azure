# Creation Summary
A Traveller’s abilities and skills are determined by training and past experience. Traveller creation begins with rolling characteristics, six values that describe your initial physical and mental capabilities. After determining characteristics and a few background skills from adolescent life, it is time to embark on a career. Each Traveller goes through one or more four-year career terms, which grant various skills and benefits. There are risks associated with each career – serving a tour of duty in the Imperial Marines may give a Traveller a good grounding in combat and weapons use but there is always the risk of injury in battle. A term spent in a corporation is unlikely to get a Traveller injured or killed but will not usually provide skills valuable in combat.

In addition to skills, Travellers pick up benefits such as cash, equipment or contacts from a career. However, there are limits on how many career terms a Traveller can go through – the risks of aging or injury mount up over time and some Travellers will move between two or three careers in their lives. At some point, you will decide to leave your career for a new life of adventure before your Traveller gets too old.

While going through a career, you can establish ties between your Traveller and those of the other players, so everyone will be old friends (or rivals!) before play begins. You will also be able to pick a skills package after everyone has finished creating their Travellers, which will allow you to fill any gaps in the group’s skill range.

## The Connections Rule
>
During Traveller creation, the aim is to not only create interesting histories for Travellers through career decisions, events and mishaps, but also to ensure Travellers know one another before the campaign begins. 
> 
This avoids every campaign starting with the words 'right, you all meet at a starport...' In Traveller, you will all know one another to some degree and can get stuck into exploration straight away.
>
If two players agree, then any event rolled for one Traveller can involve another. Only one Traveller needs to have rolled the specific event, though you will find it more exciting if Travellers can link events together (this is why it is best to create Travellers as a group activity, going through terms one by one together).
>
If an event can be linked between two Travellers in this way, then you both get one extra skill of your choice. You may gain a maximum of two free skills from the connections rule, and each connection must be with a different Traveller. For each connection you make, you may gain any skill, but cannot bring a skill above Level 3 using this rule nor may you take the Jack-of-all-Trades skill.
>
*For example, Erik is serving as an Agent, and he rolls an undercover mission (Event number 8 on the Agent Event Table). Erik's player suggests that Erik could have met*
*Kathya while on this mission, and Kathya's player agrees. They then discuss exactly what happened during the mission and this begins to form previous history for both Travel/ers. Both Erik and Kathya will then gain an extra skill because of this.*

# 1. Characteristics

**Physical Characteristics**
**Strength** (STR): A Traveller’s physical strength, fitness, and forcefulness.
**Dexterity** (DEX): Physical co-ordination and agility, reflexes.
**Endurance** (END): A Traveller’s stamina, determination, and ability to sustain damage.

**Mental Characteristics**
**Intellect** (INT): A Traveller’s intelligence and quickness of mind.
**Education** (EDU): A measure of a Traveller’s learning and experience.
**Charm** (CHR): A Traveller's charisma and ability to influence others socially.
### Rolling
1. Roll 2D fours times and record the sums.
2. Then roll 3D two times dropping the lowest die of both rolls also recording their sums.
3. Assign your rolls to your characteristics.
*If the sum of your rolls is below 42 or contains more than two stats below three, start the process from the beginning*
### Characteristic Modifiers
|**Characteristic Score**|**Dice Modifier**|
|---|---|
|0|-3|
|1-2|-2|
|3-5|-1|
|6-8|+0|
|9-11|+1|
|12-14|+2|
|15+|+3|

# 2. Background
Mostly optional, but fun way to expand your characters back story
Determine the following items:
- Family and Social Standing
- Homeworld 
- Background Event
- Background Skills

# 3. Education (Optional)

# 4. Careers
Your Traveller may engage in one or more career terms, representing their previous experiences and adventures before the start of the campaign. Each career term lasts for four years, even if a Traveller fails a Survival roll or is forced to leave a career.

At many points during a career, a Traveller will have to make a dice roll of some sort. Most of these rolls are based on characteristics – simply roll 2D, add the DM from the listed characteristic, and try to get a total higher than the listed value.

### The flow of a career term
- Select an applicable career
- roll for qualification 
## Entering a Career
### Qualification
This is what you need to roll to enter that career

If you fail this check, you cannot enter your chosen career this term. You must either submit to the Draft or take the Drifter career for this term.

You suffer DM-1 to qualification rolls for each previous career you have entered. 
If you leave a career, you cannot return to it in the next term

The Draft and Drifter career are exceptions to this rule – you can be Drafted into a career you were previously in but got ejected from, and the Drifter career is always open. 

### Drifters and the Draft
You may attempt to enlist in one career each term if you are not continuing with an existing career. If you fail to qualify for a new career, you have two options. You can either apply to the draft, and be randomly sent to one of the military services, or you may spend that term travelling as a Drifter, without true career or purpose. A Traveller may only enter the draft once in their lifetime unless otherwise stated
#### Draft Table 
| 1D | Career          | 
| -- | --------------- |
| 1  | Navy            |
| 2  | Army            |
| 3  | Marine          | 
| 4  | Merchant        |
| 5  | Scout           | 
| 6  | Law enforcement |
### Basic Training
For your first career only, you get all the skills listed in the **Service Skills table** at Level 0 as your basic training. For any subsequent careers, you may pick any one skill listed in the Service Skills table at Level 0 as your basic training.

Some careers are an exception to this! They will use their appropriate assignment skill table for basic training as listed on their career sheets.
### Commission
**This only applies to the military careers.**
A Traveller who succeeds at a commission roll becomes a rank 1 officer in that career and progresses on the officer’s rank table from then on. Trying for a commission is optional.

You may only attempt to gain a commission in your first term unless your SOC is 9 or higher, in which case you may try for a commission in any term. However, there is DM-1 applied to commission rolls for every term after the first.

Some events give a bonus DM to advancement rolls or grant automatic advancement. You can apply these DMs to commission rolls also.

If you gain a commission, you may not roll for advancement in the same term. Travellers can still roll for advancement if they fail a commission roll.
## The Career Term
### Skills and Training
Each career has four or five types of skill table associated with it – Personal Development, Service Skills, Specialist Skills (divided into three sub-tables corresponding to assignments), officer skills and Advanced Education. In each term you spend in a career, pick one of these tables and roll 1D to see which skill you increase.
### Survival
Each career has a survival roll. If you fail this roll, you must then roll on the Mishap Table. This mishap will force you to leave the career immediately unless otherwise stated. You will also lose the Benefit roll for the current term. A natural 2 on the survival roll is always a failure.
### Events
If you are still in your career after resolving the survival roll, roll on the career's Events Table to see what interesting things befall you this term. 
### Advancement
Each career has an advancement roll to represent your successful (or otherwise) path through the career. You start each career at rank 0.

If you make a successful advancement roll, move to the next higher rank and gain an extra roll on any of the skill tables available for your career, or you may make a selection of your choice from your assignment table. 
You also get any bonuses listed for your new rank. 
You may only attempt to advance once per term.

If your advancement roll is equal to or less than the number of terms you have spent in this career, then you cannot continue in this career after this term. Either your services are no longer required, or events have caused you to leave, or perhaps you are simply bored and want a new challenge.

If you roll a natural 12, then you must continue in this career. You are too valuable to lose and will be strong-armed into staying.
### Completing A Term
In the completion of a term the Traveller may decide to attempt another term, change careers, or decide stop working and become and adventurer.
#### Aging
The effects of ageing begin when a Traveller reaches the end of the fourth term, where the Traveller must roll a 2D on the aging table.
#### Changing Assignments
Instead of a whole new career, a Traveller may instead be interested in focusing on another aspect of their existing career by changing their assignment.

For most careers this simply requires a qualification roll. If this is unsuccessful, the Traveller continues in the career with the same assignment their had before without penalty. If the qualification roll is made, the Traveller now adopts the new assignment and continues in the career, retaining their rank.
  
Some careers will state that changing assignments would be considered to be new careers. Upon voluntarily leaving the career (a change in assignment cannot be done if you have been ejected from the career — no one will hire you!), Benefit rolls are made as normal and a qualification roll is necessary to enter the assignment. If this is failed, the Traveller must enter the draft or become a Drifter.

If the attempt to change assignment is successful, the career begins afresh with the new assignment, with the Traveller starting at rank 0.
#### Changing Careers
A Traveller may get forced out of a career due to a mishap or event, or may simply choose to leave voluntarily to pursue a more exciting or more lucrative life elsewhere.

To enter a new career, a Traveller must choose to end their current career and make the appropriate qualification roll at the start of a new term. If they fail, they must either submit to the draft (if they have not already done so earlier in life) or become a Drifter.
## Ending a Career
When you leave a career for any reason, you gain material benefits from that career, representing money, equipment and influence acquired during your years of work.
### Mustering Out
In the course of a Traveller’s career, they may manage to save some money. They may also acquire equipment and other benefits from their previous employers – a Scout might be mustered out of the service with a reserve Scout Ship, for example, or a Marine might get to keep their combat armour and so on. These are determined by Benefit rolls.

Benefits are gained when a Traveller leaves a career. A Traveller gets one Benefit roll for every full term served in that career. You also get extra Benefit rolls if you reached a high rank.

There are two columns for Benefit rolls in each career – the Cash column and the Other Benefits column. You may only roll on the Cash column a maximum of three times across all your careers.
#### Benefits of Rank
| Highest Rank Reached | Bonus Benefit Rolls |
| -------------------- | ------------------- |
| 1-2                  | 1                   |  
| 3-4                  | 2                   |  
| 5-6                  | 3, and DM+1 to all Benefit  rolls in this career |
### Cash Benefits
A Traveller with the Gambler skill gains DM+1 to all rolls on Cash columns.

If the Traveller has any money left, they may purchase personal equipment worth up to Cr10,000 before they start adventuring. More expensive items can be bought in play but Travellers will have to seek them out. Any left-over money can be converted into cash, trade goods or just saved.
### Benefits
When you leave a career in good standing with your previous employers, you are permitted to keep various pieces of equipment or even shares of a vessel. Different careers grant different Benefits.

<details>
<summary>Benefit Items</summary> 
- Armour: Select any type of armour with a limit of Cr10000 and TL12. If you roll this Benefit again, then you can either select another type of armour with the same limits or trade your original in for armour with a limit of Cr25000.
- Ally: Gain an Ally.
- Melee Weapon: Select any melee weapon with a limit of Cr1000 and TL12. If you roll this Benefit again, you may take another blade or one level in the Melee (blade) skill.
- Characteristic Increases: Increase the listed characteristic by the amount shown, up to your racial maximum. Human characters are limited to a score of 15. Characteristic increases above 15 are lost.
- Cybernetic Implant: Gain any augmentations (see page 106) with a limit of Cr75000 and TL12. If you roll this Benefit again, then you may either take a different augmentation or increase the one you already possess by one level of Improvement as shown on the table on page 106 (this may take it above the Credit and TL limit).
- Contact: Gain a Contact.
- Free Trader: You receive a free trader with 25% of the mortgage paid off on it. This free trader is identical to the one on page 194 but you must roll 1D times on the Spacecraft Quirks table on page 188. If you roll this Benefit again, an additional 25% of the mortgage has been paid off – if you roll this Benefit four times, the free trader will have no mortgage and it will be all yours! Alternatively, you may select a far trader (page 196) instead
- Gun: Select any common or military ranged weapon with a limit of Cr3000 and TL12. If you roll this benefit again, you may take another weapon or one level in the appropriate Gun Combat skill for a weapon already received as a Benefit.
- Lab Ship: You receive a lab ship with 25% of the mortgage paid off on it. This lab ship is identical to the one on page 206 but you must roll 1D times on the Spacecraft Quirks table on page 188. If you roll this Benefit again, an additional 25% of the mortgage has been paid off – if you roll this Benefit four times, the lab ship will have no mortgage and it will be all yours!
- Personal Vehicle: You receive a personal vehicle, such as a ground car or air/raft. You can choose exactly what type of vehicle this is but it may not be armed and has a limit of Cr300000 and TL10. If you roll this Benefit again, gain a level of Drive or Flyer.
- Scientific Equipment: Gain any one piece of scientific equipment with a limit of Cr2000 and TL12. If you roll this Benefit again, take another piece of scientific equipment or gain one level in Electronics or Science.
- Scout Ship: You receive a scout ship. You have full use of the ship and can modify it as you see fit but it still belongs to the Scout Service and can (and will!) be recalled back into service as needed. This means you will be expected to complete missions for the Scout Service from time-to-time. If you roll this Benefit more than once, re-roll the result.
- Ship’s Boat: You receive a ship’s boat or other small craft with a limit of MCr10 and TL12. If you roll this Benefit again, gain Pilot (small craft). Alternatively, receive a Ship Share instead.
- Ship Shares: You obtain one or more Ship Shares that can be put towards obtaining a ship. Each share is worth MCr1 but cannot be redeemed for cash.
- Weapon: Select any weapon with a limit of Cr3000 and TL12. If you roll this benefit again, you may take another weapon or one level in the appropriate Melee or Gun Combat skill for a weapon already received as a Benefit.
- TAS Membership: You are a member of the Traveller’s Aid Society (TAS), a private organisation that maintains hostels and facilities at all Class A and B starports in many parts of human space. Facilities are available (at reasonable cost) to members and their guests. Receipt of membership in the Traveller’s Aid Society as a benefit may be construed as a reward for heroism or extraordinary service to the Society rather than an official benefit from a career. Membership is for life and not transferable. Membership may also be purchased for MCr1, although it is possible for an application to be ‘black-balled’ by an existing member. The Traveller’s Aid Society is an exclusive organisation, made up of those who are truly citizens of the galaxy, not just a single world. The TAS invests its membership fees and other incomes; it uses its capital and return to provide benefits to its members. Every two months, it pays dividends in the form of one high passage to each member. This passage may be used, retained or sold. Membership may only be received once per Traveller. If you roll this Benefit again, receive two Ship Shares instead.
- Yacht: You receive a yacht with 25% of the mortgage paid off on it. This yacht is identical to the one on page 202 but you must roll 1D times on the Spacecraft Quirks table on page 188. If you roll this Benefit again, an additional 25% of the mortgage has been paid off – if you roll this benefit four times, the yacht will have no mortgage and it will be all yours! Alternatively, you may select a Safari Ship instead (see page 198)

</details>

#### Ship Shares
Ship Shares represent contacts, credit rating, savings and favor's owed that a Traveller can put towards ownership of a space vessel, worth roughly one million Credits. Travellers can pool their Ship Shares towards the use of a vessel but cannot trade Ship Shares for cash. It is very unlikely that the Travellers will be able to own anything but the smallest starship outright at the start of the game, so most crews end up working to support a mortgage on their spacecraft. The more Ship Shares that a group of Travellers can put together, the bigger a ship they can afford.

### Pensions
A Traveller that leaves an applicable career after at least five terms is considered to have retired and receives a pension. This pension is either paid at the beginning of each year or end of each month, effective upon leaving the service and may be collected at any Class A or B starport.

| Terms | Yearly Pay | Monthly |
| ----- | ---------- | ------- |
| 5     | Cr10000    | Cr800  |
| 6     | Cr12000    | Cr1000  |
| 7     | Cr14000    | Cr1200  |
| 8     | Cr16000    | Cr1400  |
| 9+    |  Cr2000 per term beyond 8 | +Cr200




# 5. Finalizing Your Traveller

## The Skills Package
As a group, all Travellers select one of the following skill packages. These are collections of basic skills you will often use while adventuring. Taking a skill package ensures your group will at least have basic competency in the situations that will come up in the campaign.

When you have collectively decided which skill package is most suitable for the style of play and campaign you will be embarking upon, each Traveller takes it in turns to select an item from the package. Keep going until all skills have been selected

## Filling In Your Character Sheet


# Other Concepts
## Aging
The effects of ageing begin when a Traveller reaches 34 years of age (at the end of their fourth career term). At the end of the fourth term and at the end of every term thereafter, the Traveller must roll 2D on the Ageing table. Use the Traveller’s total number of terms as a negative DM on this table; the older you are, the heavier the effects of ageing will weigh upon you.

The Traveller may choose which characteristics are affected by ageing.

| 2D | Effects of Ageing                                                                 |
| -- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | 
| -6 | Reduce three physical characteristics by 2, reduce one mental characteristic by 1 |
| -5 | Reduce three physical characteristics by 2                                        |
| -4 | Reduce two physical characteristics by 2, reduce one physical characteristic by 1 |
| -3 | Reduce one physical characteristic by 2, reduce two physical characteristic by 1  | 
| -2 | Reduce three physical characteristics by 1                                        |
| -1 | Reduce two physical characteristics by 1                                          |
| 0  | Reduce one physical characteristic by 1                                           |
| 1+ | No effect                                                                         |

**Anagathics**
At the start of any career term, a Traveller can start taking anagathics by rolling SOC 10+ (if you roll 2 exactly, you must instead go straight to the Prisoner career in this term). While using anagathic drugs, the Traveller effectively does not age – add the number of terms since the Traveller started taking anagathics as a positive DM to rolls on the Ageing table. If a Traveller stops taking anagathics for any reason in the future, then they must roll immediately on the Ageing table as the shock of their system beginning to age again strikes.

**Ageing Crisis**
If any characteristic is reduced to 0, then the Traveller suffers an ageing crisis. The Traveller dies unless they pay 1D x Cr10000 for medical care, which will bring any characteristics back up to 1. The Traveller automatically fails any qualification rolls from now on.

Anagathics have two drawbacks. First, the combined risk of trying to obtain a reliable supply and the disruption to their biochemistry means the Traveller must make two Survival checks in each term instead of one. If either or both checks are failed, the Traveller suffers a Mishap.

Second, the drugs cost 1D x Cr25000 for each term the Traveller uses the drugs. These costs are paid out of the Traveller’s eventual cash benefits. If the Traveller cannot pay these bills, they go into debt – see Medical Bills

**Ageing and Anagathics During Play**
If your campaign lasts long enough, Travellers will have to make further ageing rolls every four years. Travellers may also seek out anagathic drugs during a campaign – in fact, if a Traveller started using anagathics during creation, they may be driven to seek them out as a matter of necessity or be faced with sudden rapid ageing.
## Injuries
Travellers wounded in combat or accidents during creation must roll on the Injury table to see how bad their injuries are.

1D Injury
1 Nearly killed – reduce one physical characteristic by 1D, reduce two other physical characteristics by 2.
2 Severely injured – reduce one physical characteristic by 1D.
3 Missing Eye or Limb – reduce STR or DEX by 2.
4 Scarred – you are scarred and injured. Reduce any physical characteristic by 2.
5 Injured. Reduce any physical characteristic by 1.
6 Lightly Injured. No permanent effect.

**Medical Care**
If you have been injured, then medical care may be able to undo the effects of the damage. Although for the sake of character creation you suffer your characteristic penalties for the term following medical care during your operations and recovery.

Some worlds have the technology to clone or rebuild damaged organs; others specialize in transplants or cybernetic replacements or prosthetics. Regardless of the technique used, medical care is expensive.

The restoration of a lost characteristic costs Cr5000 per point.

If you were injured in the service of an organization, then a portion of your medical care may be paid for. Roll 2D on the Medical Bills table as listed on the career sheet.
