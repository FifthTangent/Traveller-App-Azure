# Universal Personality Profile
Travellers may be precisely defined using the Universal Personality Profile (the UPP), which expresses characteristics in a specific sequence, using hexadecimal (base 16) notation. In hexadecimal notation, the digits 0 through 9 are represented by common numbers; the digits 10 to 15 are represented by letters A through F. The highest single digit in base 16 is 15, denoted as F. Characteristics are listed as a string of six digits, in order of Strength, Dexterity, Endurance, Intellect, Education and Social Standing.

A Traveller who is average in all respects would have a UPP of 777 777. If, however, he was highly intelligent, his UPP might be 777 B77 (the B for Intellect indicating an Intellect of 11).
